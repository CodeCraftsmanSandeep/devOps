# My learning journey of devOps (Developement and Operations)

Hi ðŸ™‹ folks!!  
Welcome to my learning journey of **devOps**.  

This repository contains my notes taken while learning devOps.  

## Introduction

Before having devOps model, Waterfall Model was in use. Agile methodology.  
devOps is not a technology but a methodology.

- DevOps is the unification of Development and Operations. 
- DevOps is all about collaboration.
- DevOps is not a technology, it is cultual movement and set of practices(methodology).
- One of the major goals of DevOps is to shorten the development cycle. (may be by introducing new features, applications, updates, bug fixes)
- In a company (or) an organisation the roles and responsibilities of the operations team, DevOps team and developement team are distinct but are interconnected <br/>
    | Development team | DevOps team | Operations team |
    |:-----------------|:------------|:----------------|
    | Creating and maintaining software products | Bridging the gap between development and operations to improve efficiency and collaboration, automating processes to facilitate CI/CD | Managing and maintaining IT infrastructure and ensuring the smooth operation of IT services |
