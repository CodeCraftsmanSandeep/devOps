# My learning journey of devOps (Developement and Operations)

Hi ðŸ™‹ folks!!  
Welcome to my learning journey of **devOps**.  

This repository contains my notes taken while learning devOps.  

## Introduction

Before having devOps model, Waterfall Model was in use. Agile methodology.  
devOps is not a technology but a methodology.

- DevOps is the unification of Development and Operations. 
- DevOps is all about collaboration.
- DevOps is not a technology, it is cultual movement and set of practices(methodology).
- One of the major goals of DevOps is to shorten the development cycle. (may be by introducing new features, applications, updates, bug fixes)

#### Developement team v/s DevOps team v/s Operations team
- In a company (or) an organisation the roles and responsibilities of the operations team, DevOps team and developement team are distinct but are interconnected <br/>
    | Development team | DevOps team | Operations team |
    |:-----------------|:------------|:----------------|
    | Creating and maintaining software products | Bridging the gap between development and operations to improve efficiency and collaboration, automating processes to facilitate CI/CD | Managing and maintaining IT infrastructure and ensuring the smooth operation of IT services |
    | Goal: How fast they can develop? | Goal: Bring development and operations team together | Goal: How stable is the software is? |

#### DevOps Loop and goals
- DevOps creators are us!! (software community)
- DevOps Loop: Plan --> Build --> CI/CD --> Monitor and Alert --> Operate --> Continuous feedback --> Plan
- DevOps address the issue of conflicting goals betweeen development and operations teams by merging both teams into one DevOps team with shared goals of speed and stability.
- DevOps goals: 
  - Decrease developement cycle time. Which thereby decreases the time to take ideas to market.
  - Efficiency (by collaboration of developers and operations team).
  - Improving the quality of software by continuous monitoring, CI and CD.
  - Improve security (Which is DevSecOps) by involving security team.
